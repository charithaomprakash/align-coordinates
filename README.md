# align-coordinates

# This package can be used to align the position coordinates(x, y) for each body marker(nosetip, paws, talibase etc.) obtained from DeepLabCut (DLC), over days to a single reference frame.

# During the course of the experiment, the location of the experimental set-up changes(which leads to large differences in place cell analysis/ analysing the time spent by a mouse in a certain location etc.) It is important to make sure that the postions are aligned so we can have reliable and comparable results across different groups/conditions.

# The output of the notebooks can then be used to perform some basic behavior analysis.
